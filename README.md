## Sooo what is this???  
a web client for Mastodon, is what i plan it to be.
**Note this WILL be buggy since I am a failure at node.js.**  
## Minimum hosting requirements
Recommended: Node.js 14.18.0, Ubuntu or an Ubuntu based OS, and a decent enough computer.  
**Required: Don't know as of yet. Again this project is in a very early stage and I don't have a working prototype yet.**
